1. created a database and table with some data
2. created a new WEBAPI project shoppingAPI
3. Enable Entity framework, by adding 4 nuget packages
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
		Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
4. We need to generate POCO classes - Plain C# Objects
		this are classes mapped to tables in database
		classes will have properties - mapped to coloumns in table


	tools -> Nuget package manager -> package manager console

	Scaffold-DbContext "connection string" -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
		-outPutDir Models

Scaffold-DbContext "server=NIKHILPC\MUMBAISERVER;database=shoppingDB_2;integrated security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true" -Provider Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir Models 

5. Build the project
6. Add new API controller --> right click on controller folder, add, controller, api controller using EF
 choose table name in Model drop down, choose dbcontext file and give a meaningful name to controller
7. In the controller file, it tries to use Dependency Injection, which is a good practice but since we are yet to study it, we will remove it
	a. instatiate new object of Dbcontext with 
			= new ShoppingDbContext();

	b. comment the constructor

8. build and run the project
