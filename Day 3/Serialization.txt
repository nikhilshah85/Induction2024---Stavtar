				Serialization
	Serialization is a process to persist state of an object from 1 place to other place
					(ram to disk)
					(ram to another ram)

	Deserialization is a process to bring the object back to same state (open the object)

	----------------------------
		Formats of data which can be used by serialization
			binary format (light weight but not cross platform)
			xml format (cross platform - little bit heavy and slow) - data only
			SOAP (Simple object access protocol) - XML based format - but more detailed
							data + schema
				used a lot in WebServices

			JSON (JavaScript object Notation) - used in REST services
				This is more lighter, faster and flexible
				cross platform
				Problems with Webservices are solved by this technology
				based on HTTP web standards
