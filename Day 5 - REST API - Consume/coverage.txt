What are services (background services)
		Dependency Injection
		CORS (Cross Origin Resource Shareing)
		oAuth - Add Facebook, Google, linkedin, twitter, O365 


Middlware -- once you add the service above, you on and off with middleware
-------------------------------

	1. create a new api application - use EF and understand DI - use DI service
	2. you will try to consume this api - and you will get cors error
	3. we will add cors service and middleware to allow access
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			What is DI ?

	we create lots of objects but we do not destroy them, so they keep lying on the ram

	big frameworks like Java, .Net they have garbage collector, which comes at a random time and 
		clears the memory 
	
		
	What is not been introduced globally, is DI
		which means Developer will not create any object, 

		instead, runtime will create the object and destroy the object 
			it will destroy it based on the Lifecycle method which developer will configure

			there are 3 methods

			a. AddTranscient - (Per call)  - dynamic data
			b. AddScoped - (per session) - per user - personal data
			c. AddSingleton (1 global object) 


1. Create a new WebAPI application 
2. Add a class - Accounts, add 5 properties to it and list of employee variable with 5 employees
		have 2 methods, 
		getallAccounts
		getAccbyAccN
		AddAccount
3. Add a Api controller and make all 3 methods available to client by adding Iactionresult method

4. Add support for EF - add 4 nugets
5. download poco classes - use EmployeeDB from yesterday, which had employee and dept tables
6. create controllers for both of them
------------------
	test api and make sure all the links are working well
	
	we will implement DI on the same
