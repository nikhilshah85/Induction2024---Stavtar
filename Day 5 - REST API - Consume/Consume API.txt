		Consume API
			there are 2 ways / 2 approach 

		
		1. Consume From Client Side - Availble in WebAPP's(JavaScript)
			Fastest way to get the data
			Less secure for sensitive data
			We use fetch api for the same - fetch api is a - it is build into every browser
				fetch api is a javascript based api - part of every browser
				It returns a promise
		2. Consume From server side - using programming C#, Typescript, Java, C++ etc..
				Standard class 
						HttpClient class 
			this is little bit slower than above, but very safe and secure

			can be used for Web, Desktop app like console and winforms/wpf etc...
